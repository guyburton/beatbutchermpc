BeatButcherMPC Patched Phrase Editor
==============

I have finally gotten around to releasing the source code for BeatButcherMPC. 
This was originally written when I was a student in 2008, and revised slightly for a second relase in 2010. 

These are things I am NOT proud of:

* The code and project structure (I was still learning Java, give me a break)
* The fact it has taken me 6 whole years to open source it
* The fact that after the inital beta it took 3 years to release another version
* The fact that I lost the communities faith by taking so long

Anyway, here it is. There is also a branch for the Beta version, which is buggy and frankly a mess.

Note: It will take me a while to get everything published correctly.

Build
=====

Use the command 'ant clean build MainWindow' to execute. Or import into eclipse and run the PatchedPhraseEditor project.
